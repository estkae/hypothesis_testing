Areas of Research:
1. Sources of Electricity  (fuel types)
2. Seasonality of:
    -Net Generation
    -Consumption
    -Price

**Question 1:** (Consumption)
What is the difference in New York's electricity consumption per season?

    H0: Mean fuel consumption of each season are equal
    H1: Mean fuel consumption of each season are not equal

    ***Tests Used:***
    - ANOVA where we compare means across multiple groups (seasons).
    - Tukeys HSD which provided us with multiple comparisons of the mean.

    ***IV:***  Seasons - Discrete
    ***DV:*** Fossil Fuels Consumption(thsnd tons) - Continuous
